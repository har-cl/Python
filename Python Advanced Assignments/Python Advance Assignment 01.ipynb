    "### Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    " Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\n",
    "- In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming. \n",
    "- It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "- The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some Advantages are mentioned below:\n",
    "- It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making problem solving easy through the use of objects\n",
    "- Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
    "- Multiple instances of an object can be made and explored."

    "### Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Python searches for an attribute in an upward tree of attributes. it first searches for the attribute in its instance and then looks in the class it is generated from, to all super classes listed in its class header\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every time you use an expression of the form ```object.attr``` where object is an instance or class object, Python searches the namespace tree at and above object, for the first attr it can find. \n",
    "* Lower definitions in the tree override higher ones, inheritance forms the basis of specialization.\n",

    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The differences between a class object and an instance object are:\n",
    "1. Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class\n",
    "2. Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. but for a class this doesnot happens.\n",
    "3. A Class is created once. Many objects are created using a class.\n",
    "4. As Classes have no allocated memory. they can't be manipulated. but objects can be manipulated."

    "- Instance Methods (object level methods)\n",
    "- Class Methods (class level methods)\n",
    "- Static Methods (general utility methods)\n",
