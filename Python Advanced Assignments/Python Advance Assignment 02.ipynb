    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "A Python class is like an outline/blueprint/mold for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas in Python, Modules are simply files with the `. py` extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes that you want to include in your application."

Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by all objects of the classs. instead each object maintains its own copy of instance attributes at object level. whereas incase of class attributes all instances of class refer to a single copy. Usually instance attributes are defined within the **`__init__`** method of class\n",

Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class. The user can notice that the same inbuilt operator or function is showing different behaviour for objects of different classes. This process is known as operator overloading.\n",
