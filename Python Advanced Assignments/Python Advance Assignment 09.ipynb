    "**Ans:** \n",

    "The major difference between these two is that a text file contains textual information in the form of alphabets, digits and special characters or symbols. On the other hand, a binary file contains bytes or a compiled version of a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is opened in **text mode**, reading its data automatically decodes its content (as per the platform default or as per provided encoding), and returns it as a **str**; writing operation takes a **str**, and automatically encodes it before transferring to the file. Text mode files also support universal end-of-line translation, and encoding specification arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is opened in **binary mode** by adding a **`b`** to the mode string argument in the `open()` call, reading its data does not decode it in any way, and simply returns its content raw and unchanged, as a bytes object; writing takes a bytes object and transfers it to the file unchanged. Binary-mode files also accept a bytearray object for the content to be written to the file."

Unicode strings are more versatile than ASCII strings, which are the Python 3.X default, as they can store letters from foreign languages as well as emoji and the standard Roman letters and numerals."
