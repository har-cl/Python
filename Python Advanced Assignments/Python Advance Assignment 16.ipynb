    "### Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps us to match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world.\n",
    "The Python module re provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. The re module raises the exception re.error if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions, also known as `regex` or `regexp`, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. it helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. it also avoids multiple use of `if/else` statements."

    "### Q2. Describe the difference between the effects of \"(ab)c+\" and \"a(bc)+\" Which of these, if any, is the unqualified pattern \"abc+\"?\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The result of both of them will be basically computed using the BOADMAS rule according to mathematics so results will be different in both case. taking in terms of regular espressions it causes the resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE. (ab)c+ will match ‘ab’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘c’s; it will not match just ‘ab’. similarly for a(bc)+ it will match ‘a’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘bc’s; it will not match just ‘a’. `(ab)c+` and `a(bc)+` are valid patterns. the difference between both these patterns is in `(ab)c+` `ab` is group whereas in `a(bc)+` `bc` is a group."

    "**Ans:** \n",

    "\n",

    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The `re.search()` and `re.match()` both are functions of re module in python. These functions are very efficient and fast for searching in strings. The function searches for some substring in a string and returns a match object if found, else it returns none.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a difference between the use of both functions. Both return the first match of a substring found in the string, but `re.match()` searches only from the beginning of the string and return match object if found. But if a match of substring is found somewhere in the middle of the string, it returns none. \n",
    "\n",
