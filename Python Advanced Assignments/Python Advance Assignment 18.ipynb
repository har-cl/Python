    "The differences between Text Files and Binary Files are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Text files` are special subset of binary files that are used to store human readable characters as a rich text document or plain text document. Text files also store data in sequential bytes but bits in text file represents characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Binary files` are those typical files that store data in the form of sequence of bytes grouped into eight bits or sometimes sixteen bits. These bits represent custom data and such files can store multiple types of data (images, audio, text, etc) under a single file."

    "\n",
    "Binary files are used to store data more compactly. In the text file, a special character whose ASCII value is 26 inserted after the last character to mark the end of file. In the binary file no such character is present. Files keep track of the end of the file from the number of characters present."

    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "its acutally easy to read a write abinary file with rb and wb mode Alternatively we can use open() and close() can be called explicitly. However, this method requires us to perform error handling ourself, that is, ensure that the file is always closed, even if there is an error during writing. So, using the “with” statement is better in this regard as it will automatically close the file when the block ends.\n",
