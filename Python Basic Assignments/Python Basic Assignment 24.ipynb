    "**Ans:** \n",

    "`def` statement is used to create a normal function. where as `lamba` expressions are used to create `Anonymous functions`. which can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Lambdas` are one-line functions without a name, in other words using lambdas we can create anonymous functions in python. Lambda functions work practically the same as any other method in Python. Lambdas differ from normal Python methods because they can have only one expression, and they can't contain any statements and their return type is a function object\n",
