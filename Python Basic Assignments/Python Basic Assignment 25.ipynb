    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "An `iterator` is an object which contains a countable number of values and it is used to iterate over iterable objects like list, tuples, sets, etc. Iterators are implemented using a class. It follows lazy evaluation where the evaluation of the expression will be on hold and stored in the memory until the item is called specifically which helps us to avoid repeated evaluation. As lazy evaluation is implemented, it requires only 1 memory location to process the value and when we are using a large dataset then, wastage of RAM space will be reduced the need to load the entire dataset at the same time will not be there.For an iterator: `iter()` keyword is used to create an iterator containing an iterable object.`next()` \n",
    "keyword is used to call the next element in the iterable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly `Generators` are an another way of creating iterators in a simple way where it uses the keyword `yield` statement instead of `return` statement in a defined function.Generators are implemented using a function. Just as iterators, generators also follow `lazy evaluation`. Here, the yield function returns the data without affecting or exiting the function. It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they won’t store the entire sequence in the memory.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function. The yield statement suspends function’s execution and sends a value back to the caller, but retains enough state to enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them back like a list."
